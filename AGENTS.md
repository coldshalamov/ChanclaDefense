## Inside Jokes & Canonical Elements

This codebase contains several "inside jokes" and specific design choices that define the game's personality. These elements **MUST NOT** be changed or "improved" without explicit instruction from the user.

### The "Leg" Special Attack
- **Emoji:** `🦵` (Leg)
- **Concept:** The player's special attack is a giant leg. This is a core part of the game's humor.
- **Do Not Change To:** Flowers, bouquets, hearts, or generic projectiles.
- **Dialogue:** Lines referencing "jamón" (ham) or the leg are intentional.
  - Example: "Hora del jamón, cariño!" is correct.
  - Do not add romantic lines like "Flores para mi reina!" which contradict the joke.

### General Guidelines
- **Preserve Dialogue:** Do not alter existing dialogue lines unless fixing a typo. The specific phrasing is part of the character voice.
- **Consult Before Changing Visuals:** If a visual element seems "weird" (like a leg projectile), assume it is intentional and check before changing it.
